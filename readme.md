# OH NO

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has placed a curse on the source code of Hogwarts' administration software. Errors, typos, and bugs abound! Literally nothing works.

## Your Mission

You're Rubyist Hagrid, a member of Dumbledore's Army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

> The errors are all in locations that we've covered in class. (Even Voldemort's not that heartless!) Also, there are no changes necessary in the `app/assets` folder.

> Making sure your HTML and CSS validate is still important! If you copy an paste a `.erb` file it won't validate, however -- so copy and paste the resulting HTML as it shows up in your web browser.

## Bonus

Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (creating a new student). Include a "Sorting Hat" method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
